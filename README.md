YarkNet is a research dashboard that predicts how the Yarkovsky effect subtly alters an asteroid’s orbit and reports the expected drift with an honest uncertainty band. It also ranks targets for follow-up by combining prediction confidence, close-approach risk (MOID), and size, and visualizes how the drift would change their paths over time.
