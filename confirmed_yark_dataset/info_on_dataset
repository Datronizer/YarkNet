Abstract:
    The measurement of the Yarkovsky effect on near-Earth asteroids (NEAs)
    is common practice in orbit determination today, and the number of
    detections will increase with the developments of new and more
    accurate telescopic surveys. However, the process of finding new
    detections and identifying spurious ones is not yet automated, and it
    often relies on personal judgment.

    We aim to introduce a more automated procedure that can search for NEA
    candidates to measure the Yarkovsky effect, and that can identify
    spurious detections.

    The expected semi-major axis drift on an NEA caused by the Yarkovsky
    effect was computed with a Monte Carlo method on a statistical model
    of the physical parameters of the asteroid that relies on the most
    recent NEA population models and data. The expected drift was used to
    select candidates in which the Yarkovsky effect might be detected,
    according to the current knowledge of their orbit and the length of
    their observational arc. Then, a nongravitational acceleration along
    the transverse direction was estimated through orbit determination for
    each candidate. If the detected acceleration was statistically
    significant, we performed a statistical test to determine whether it
    was compatible with the Yarkovsky effect model. Finally, we determined
    the dependence on an isolated tracklet.

    Among the known NEAs, our procedure automatically found 348 detections
    of the Yarkovsky effect that were accepted. The results are overall
    compatible with the predicted trend with the the inverse of the
    diameter, and the procedure appears to be efficient in identifying and
    rejecting spurious detections. This algorithm is now adopted by the
    ESA NEO Coordination Centre to periodically update the catalogue of
    NEAs with a measurable Yarkovsky effect, and the results are
    automatically posted on the web portal.

Description:
    The Yarkovsky effect determinations can be used to extrapolate the
    ratio of retrograde-to-prograde rotators (R/P), because negative
    (positive) semi-major axis drift values are associated with retrograde
    (prograde) rotators. To this purpose, we randomly generate 10000
    values of A2, for each positive detections. In this process, we
    assumed A2 to be a Gaussian random variable, with mean value equal to
    the nominal value and standard deviation equal to the 1-{sigma}
    uncertainty of the detection.
